In a personal document, write down some of your thoughts on Cybersecurity.

What did you like about Cybersecurity? What didnâ€™t you like?

I like the diversity of the field and what you are capable of finding out! It is a puzzle of almost "what can I do to get this information I need" and like a game of hide and go seek. I enjoy that aspect. Overall, there really isn't much to dislike personally, the only thing I can say is a bit overwhelming to remember all steps/tools/etc. out there! I know with time I will be able to accomplish more and with experience this will soon become an issue of the past.

What would pursuing Cybersecurity look like for you?

I personally want to become a Analyst first, realistically this is the best beginner position I believe, to review a companies network and ensure no outside interferences are occuring and if so, follow the company playbook for incidence response. Ideally after some years of on the job experience, I know I like to grow within my skill so I know I would then go for some sort of engineer position or managerial position for a company and that's what I envision pursing Cybersecurity would look like for me.
